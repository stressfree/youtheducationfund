                        although this term can be broadly interpreted. The Fund will not cover general tuition fees, unless there are unusual
                        circumstances.

                    <h3>About the Fund</h3>
                    <p>
                        The late Sir John McKenzie so appreciated the success of McKenzies stores 
                        in this country and the support given him by the people of New Zealand,
                        that he founded the Youth Education Trust Fund in 1938 to help deserving young people to receive education.
                        Since its inception, thousands of young New Zealanders have received assistance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Income for Distribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The income of the fund comes from dividends and interest, and an annual grant from the J R McKenzie Trust. 
                        This income tends to vary, dependent upon the success of Rangitira Pty Ltd, as the Fund and the Trust have 
                        substantial shareholdings in this Company
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Administration</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Fund is administered entirely by the Rotary clubs of North Harbour, Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch
                        and Dunedin.  These clubs have a separate committee who receive and consider all applications from the individuals
                        (through Rotarians) other Rotary clubs, community organisations, school principals, ministers and social workers.
                        After considering the degree of hardship and seeing evidence of a degree of self-help, they distribute grants to the most
                        deserving cases through the nearest Rotary Club, who can discuss problems and offer advice, if requested. Applications
                        are invited around September of each year, but can be made at any time.
