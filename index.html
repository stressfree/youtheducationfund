                    The late Sir John McKenzie so appreciated the success of McKenzies stores 
                    in this country and the support given him by the people of New Zealand,
                    that he founded the Youth Education Trust Fund to help deserving young people to receive education.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The J R McKenzie Youth Education Fund was set up in 1938, its main purpose being:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "to assist in the betterment, education, advancement and physical welfare of the youth
                    in the community, particularly in cases where bereavement, sickness or family disturbances
                    leave the children in need of assistance if they are to continue their studies".
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Since its inception, thousands of young New Zealanders have received assistance.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Criteria</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fund wishes to help where death, sickness, family break up or economic hardship cause difficulty for young people
                    and their caregivers to meet the costs of their education. Applications must be related to a young person's education,
                    although this term can be broadly interpreted. The Fund will not cover general tuition fees, unless there are unusual
                    circumstances.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Types of Grants Made</h2>
                <p>Depending upon local criteria, grants may cover:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>School uniforms and clothing and footwear.</li>
                    <li>Special tuition or course fees.</li>
                    <li>Text books and stationery.</li>
                    <li>Special grants especially for glasses or to help students with special needs.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>Application Form</h2>
                <p>
                    Grants are available to individuals not organisations. The form can be <a href="yef-application.pdf">downloaded from here</a>.
                </p>
                <p><em>Please note</em>, additional information maybe requested.</p>
                
                <h2>Income for Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    The income of the fund comes from dividends and interest, and an annual grant from the J R McKenzie Trust. 
                    This income tends to vary, dependent upon the success of Rangitira Pty Ltd, as the Fund and the Trust have substantial shareholdings in this Company
                </p>
                
                <h2>Administration</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fund is administered entirely by the Rotary clubs of North Harbour, Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch
                    and Dunedin.  These clubs have a separate committee who receive and consider all applications from the individuals
                    (through Rotarians) other Rotary clubs, community organizations, school principals, ministers and social workers.
                    After considering the degree of hardship and seeing evidence of a degree of self-help, they distribute grants to the most
                    deserving cases through the nearest Rotary Club, who can discuss problems and offer advice, if requested. Applications
                    are invited around September of each year, but can be made at any time.
                </p>
